World Boundaries
These are derived from the public domain Natural Earth(http://www.naturalearthdata.com/downloads/) cultural vector files, 110m resolution. Then, ogr2ogr was used to convert to GeoJSON. Lastly, the data was cleaned up slightly, removing extra properties and a degenerate edge from Antarctica and D3 example data set.
